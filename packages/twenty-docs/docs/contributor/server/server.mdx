## Tech Stack

Twenty primarily uses NestJS for the backend. 

Prisma was the first ORM we used. But in order to allow users to create custom fields and custom objects, a lower-level made more sense as we need to have fine-grained control. The project now uses TypeORM. 

Here's what the tech stack now looks like. 


**Core**
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
- [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server)

**Database**
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

**Third-party integrations**
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for tracking bugs

**Testing**
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

**Tooling**
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

**Development**
- [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
