## CR line breaks found [Windows]

This is due to the line break characters of Windows and the git configuration. Try running:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Then delete the repository and clone it again.

## Missing metadata schema

During Twenty installation, you need to provision your postgres database with the right schemas, extensions, and users.
This documentation includes [different ways](/start/local-setup/yarn-setup#step-2-set-up-postgresql-database) to set up your postgres instance.

If you're successful in running this provisioning, you should have `default` and `metadata` schemas in your database.
If you don't, make sure you don't have more than one postgres instance running on your computer.

## Cannot find module 'twenty-emails' or its corresponding type declarations.

You have to build the package `twenty-emails` before running the initialization of the database with `yarn nx run twenty-emails:build`

## Missing twenty-x package

Make sure to run yarn in the root directory and then run `yarn nx server:dev twenty-server`. If this still doesn't work try building the missing package manually.

## Lint on Save not working

This should work out of the box with the eslint extension installed. If this doens't work try adding this to your vscode setting (on the dev container scope):

```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
}
```
