// Keep track of the tabs in which the "Add to Twenty" button has already been injected.
// Could be that the content script is executed at "https://linkedin.com/feed/", but is needed at "https://linkedin.com/in/mabdullahabaid/".
// However, since Linkedin is a SPA, the script would not be re-executed when you navigate to "https://linkedin.com/in/mabdullahabaid/" from a user action.
// Therefore, this tracks if the user is on desired route and then re-executes the content script to create the "Add to Twenty" button.
// We use a "Set" to keep track of tab ids because it could be that the "Add to Twenty" button was created at "https://linkedin/com/company/twenty".
// However, when we change to about on the company page, the url becomes "https://www.linkedin.com/company/twenty/about/" and the button is created again.
// This creates a duplicate button, which we want to avoid. So, we instruct the extension to only create the button once for any of the following urls.
// "https://www.linkedin.com/company/twenty/" "https://www.linkedin.com/company/twenty/about/" "https://www.linkedin.com/company/twenty/people/".
